== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What exactly does this plugin do? =

This plugin appends a warning message to any content that is illegally copied or scraped from your site. When a content scraper grabs any content from your feeds, then the plugin will silently append a notice, along with the source link, to the scraped content (and so so for each piece of content scraped). The same will happen when anyone uses the text highlight and copy method via mouse or keyboard.

= Can I change the output message? =

Sure! The feed message can be changed on line 64 of the illegalcopy.php file, and the main append message can be changed on line 82 of the illegalcopy.php file. Should you need help, do send us an email.
